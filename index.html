    <h1>ReCal Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><em>Effective Date: February 18, 2026</em></p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>ReCal is designed with privacy as a core principle. Your health and fitness data never leaves your device.</p>

    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p>ReCal does not collect, transmit, or store any user data on external servers. All data is stored locally on your device using the Android Room database and backed up to your personal Google Drive App Data folder (if you enable backup). This backup is only accessible to you and to ReCal on your own devices.</p>

    <h2>Health Connect Data</h2>
    <p>ReCal accesses your weight and nutrition data via the Android Health Connect API. This data is read from Health Connect, processed locally on your device, and stored in the local database. ReCal does not share this data with any third parties.</p>

    <h2>Google Play Billing</h2>
    <p>When you purchase ReCal, Google Play handles the transaction. We do not collect or store your payment information. Google Play's privacy policy applies to purchase transactions.</p>
